    - If this is the first time using the application, you might have a delay as the services are initially hydrated


**Congratulations!  You have successfully built and deployed a functioning DevOps pipeline that includes continuous integration.  You have completed all the lab exercises, and you are free to explore more in the Azure environment provisioned for you.**
